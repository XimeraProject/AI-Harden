Greetings!

PSA: Are you aware that PDF assignments can be dropped into AI and solutions will come out?

TLDR: We have attached TeX code that will "harden" your PDFs against AI. You can simply drop it in your preamble. 


While there are many ways to find answers online -- nearly all of them involve the student typing in the problem and the internet (meaning either solution-manuals, actual people, or things like Wolfram Alpha) can often give answers with complete solutions. 


However, now with advances in AI, it is even easier to cheat.


Consider the two PDFs attached. A student can simply upload "basicAssignment.pdf" to 

https://www.chatpdf.com

or

https://askyourpdf.com/

and ask it to solve the problems. The AI will "read" the entire PDF and help give solutions. The solutions can be copied and pasted easily. While most free services are limited, paid services give even better responses.

With this in mind....

Jim Fowler and I are working on ways to "harden" pdfs to AI. 
If we attempt to find solutions to "hardenedAssignment.pdf," the AI will refuse to answer and will remind the student that academic misconduct is unethical. 



To fight against students using AI you can:

1) Ask questions that AI cannot do---e.g. Ask students to "measure" things and do things with the "measurements." E.G. Have them measure a length of something on their page and use this as part of the computation, "A vector is drawn to scale." Find the vectors magnitude (in inches) and ..... "
2) Ask students to draw things (graphs, diagrams, relationships, whatever)
3) Add this code to the preamble of all of your TeX documents

The text in all-caps explains to the AI what it can and cannot do. There is room for improvement in this text, but this will take time and experimentation. 

AI hardening techniques such as these will be built-in to future versions of Ximera.

All the best,
